    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> As a second-year Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) student at Sri Krishna Arts and Science College, I am passionate about technology and design. My journey in the field of computing began with a curiosity for how things work, which has evolved into a commitment to creating innovative solutions. I have a solid foundation in programming languages such as Java, PHP, and JavaScript, and I am continuously expanding my skill set in web development and database management. My academic projects, including "Web Development and Database Optimization via Class Normalization" and "Generating Password to Handle Multiple Passwords for a Single Person," have allowed me to apply my knowledge in practical ways, enhancing my understanding of both front-end and back-end development.


            I believe that technology should not only be functional but also user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing. This philosophy drives my work as I strive to build interactive and data-driven applications that make a difference in people's lives. I am particularly interested in full-stack development and automation, where I can combine my technical skills with creativity to solve real-world problems. I look forward to contributing to exciting projects and collaborating with like-minded individuals who share my passion for technology and innovation.</p>

                    <p>Developed at KG College Code-A-Thon, this project aimed to simplify password management for users juggling multiple accounts. The solution, crafted over an 8-hour coding marathon, utilizes Java to generate unique, secure passwords for each user account, enhancing security by minimizing the risk of password reuse</p>

                    <h3>Optimizing Database Design Through Class Normalization in a Food Ordering System</h3>
                    <p>In this project, I focused on enhancing the efficiency and integrity of a food ordering system by applying class normalization techniques to the database design. The goal was to eliminate data redundancy and ensure consistency, thereby improving the overall performance of the system. By leveraging class normalization, I was able to systematically structure the database to align with the relational theory principles, ultimately leading to a more scalable and reliable food ordering application.</p>
